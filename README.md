# Gold Standard
## A Laravel boilerplate resource

This repo is an example of what I consider to be a "gold standard" of serving a resource with the Laravel framework. I've tried to demonstrate how to simply and cleanly put together a tested resource as a reference to other developers. This is how I teach newer Laravel developers to approach tackling this sort of problem.

### Get started

This repo is set up in the structure of a Laravel project but only contains the files needed to demonstrate the code and organisation. Everything else has been removed.

As you browse through the directories that do exist you'll see additional README files that explain the approach and best practices for that part of the app. If you're browsing on GitHub you should see the relevant README display as you wander.

I try to follow the Laravel convention wherever possible, and where none exists I try to be Laravel-flavoured.

### Contributions

I'd be honoured for any suggestions or improvements to this repo. I've started it off as what I consider to be my "gold standard" at this point in time, but as the framework and it's community evolve this will change as well. If you've got anything to add please open an issue or make a pull request.
